Simple bash script that builds jquery gallery.

Notes:
"_tmp" dir hosts header.part file, which gets prepended to index.html. feel free to modify it.
"misc" dir hosts javascript dependencies.

Options:
-f <path> = define path to full images. defaults to "full". Note - this should be a relative path to index.html dir
-t <path> = define path to thumbnails. defaults to "thumbs". Note - this should be a relative path to index.html dir
